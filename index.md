# Why do we need an application in the donation of blood field?

  It is very important for a person to be aware of the importance of blood donation!
For now, a blood substitute has not been found so donation is the only solution to cope with the blood needs and blood components needed for transfusion therapy. Doctors and surgeons rely on blood donation to perform a series of interventions that save people's lives every day or extend it.

  In Romania, the situation is worrying because less than **2% of people** choose to donate blood, and this is primarily due to the fact that they are not sufficiently informed about the need for blood.
 
  The blood crisis faced by most hospitals in Romania generates situations at the limit of the law. There are doctors who ask the relatives of the patients to call as many people as possible to donate for the sick. Some doctors say that without these donors the patient will not receive blood, although this is illegal and can  be punished with imprisonment.  	
Social networks are filled with desperate calls for people to search for donors for patients in serious medical conditions. Those that can may be asked to go to the harvesting centers and say the name of the patient for whom they donate blood.

  People need to be stimulated and understand this need, and we thought about a nice way to do this. With the help of the application, people will be notified when blood is needed in hospitals and will be displayed at the nearest donation center.


# How should look this application?

  Today there are many people who are willing to donate blood, but because of the lack of centralization of information about the amount of blood that is needed, people quit  very easily searching for a harvesting center. That's why our start-up offers the opportunity to find the nearest harvest place in just a few minutes. 

  The user inserts the blood group (optional step) on our page and we provide information about hospitals that need high blood or even the nearest harvesting center. People can also enter contact information as well the blood group to be notified in emergency cases by hospitals. This way, the people will be motivated to donate blood knowing that someone need it urgently.
From one of the application page, people will be able to see a live chart of how much blood is left, and we believe that this is will make a big impact in their decision to come to donate.
Also we want to let them know when their blood is used, because it's a great feeling to know that you could be part of saving a life.

  For people who donate the first time there is an information page where they can see the steps they have to follow and what is recommended to do before the donation.


# Customer segments

  **app name** is a product targeting blood donation in the medical industry. This product is designated in the **multi-side market** with three types of clients: clinics/hospitals (private or public), individuals and research laboratories. **Hospitals** are our most important customer, because in order to be able to expose their blood level data, they have to pay a monthly sum of money. **Individuals** are also important because the amount of blood donated affects the decision of hospitals to continue contributing to the application. **Research laboratories** could have the opportunity to inform people who want to contribute with blood in a simple way by using out notification system.


# Competition

### DonezSange & CtsBucuresti
  Regarding the competition, we chose three application to analyze following up with our application advantages compare to them. 
In Romania, we found the websites www.donezsange.ro and www.ctsbucuresti.ro. These are just some websites presenting information about blood, blood donation, blood banks. These are not interactive and offer too much information. The pages are very loaded, so the donation information is harder to access and process. These are available only in Romania and they only contain the hospitals in Romania, so they can not be extended. There are no notifications when blood is needed, there are also no charts or information about how much blood is available in hospitals.

### Donez 450

  Donez450 (https://donez450.ro/) is a national online project that aims to facilitate the blood donation process by mediating communication between blood transfusion centers in Romania and potential donors, using email or sms notifications.
They provide information about why you should donate, where you can donate, what are the conditions you have to meet in order to donate and how you can enter the active community of those who donate in Romania.

### Blood Donor

  The American Red Cross Blood Donor App it'a mobile application that aims to notify people from America when blood is needed in hospitals. Find nearby Red Cross blood drives, schedule appointments, follow your blood's journey from donation through delivery (when possible), and create or join a lifesaving team. This is a strong competitor, but can only be used by people in America, so it cannot be extended internationally.

# Our advantages

  Our application makes the blood donation process easier by facilitating the communication between blood banks in Romania and donors.
We don't come with different material rewards (such as meal vouchers or free transport) as the Romanian state does now, because we believe that people that donated blood will be more impressed when they will be noticed that their blood saved a life. Also we think that the fact that they can see live charts of how much blood is left in hospitals will make them want to donate. 
Also we want them to be informed about the blood donation process and to know how to reach the nearest center so our application will provide them these information.

  Our application can be extended, as the cities will be into a database and it will be possible to use it internationally.
These are the advantages **app name** has, compared with the others in the list above. Together, we have the resources to be the support that the medical system in Romania needs for blood donation to no longer be a problem.

# Key metrics

# Cost structure

# Revenue streams

  **Usage fee** is generated by the use of a particular service. In our startup, the more the customer uses the notification system the more he pays. The default number of notifications is 1 per day but if this number is exceeded there is a tax.

  **Subscription fees** are coming from the monthly subscriptions in exchange for access our application.
Also, this are different depending on the type of customer. For example, a research laboratory pays a price much bigger than a public hospital.

  **Advertising stream** results from fees for advertising a particular service. For example, organizing an event for a research laboratory where specialized people can come and talk about how important or how is used the blood for the research programs.
